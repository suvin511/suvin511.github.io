## Rescue Maze Entry Rules 

Maze Entry Rules are easy to understand. It is a maze with no way out and with some obstacles, holes, checkpoints, ramps and victims to rescue. 

- The victim is marked as a red cross and the robot must stand on it for about 5 seconds. These 5 seconds make sure that the robot spoted the victim.
- The checkpoints are there for when the robot gets stuck or goes into a hole. If you find the checkpoint, you don't need to do anything and just go past.
- The holes you must avoid has some rules too. If the robot is more than half of itself in the hole, it has to go back to the checkpoint. The hole is marked as a black spot.
- The obstacles must be avoided or go right over them, so go pass them. They can be long sticks that are thin and spreaded on the ground or speed bumps that must be runned over. Speed bumps are also a long stick that is much bigger and thicker.

## Points in Rescue Maze Entry

- Speed bumps = 10 points
- Ramp going downward = 10 points
- Ramp going upward = 20 points
- Victim found = 10 points
- Checkpoint found = 10 points

The team with the most points comes to first place. 

## Hardware of the robot

- 2 Motors: There are responsible for the robots to move.
- 2 Ultrasonic Sensor: They are responsible for turning when they see the wall.
